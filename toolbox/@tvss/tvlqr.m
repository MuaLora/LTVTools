% tvlqr  Linear-quadratic regulator design for time-varying systems.
%
%   [K,P,Pdot] = tvlqr(SYS,Q,R,N,F,Tspan) calculates the optimal time-varying
%   gain matrix K such that:
%
%     * For a continuous-time, time-varying model SYS, the state-feedback
%       law u(t) = -K(t)x(t)  minimizes the cost function
%             J = x(T)'F x(T) + Integral_T0^Tf {x'Qx + u'Ru + 2*x'Nu} dt
%             subject to the system dynamics  dx/dt = Ax + Bu.
%       where Tspan = [T0 Tf].
%
%     % For a discrete-time, time-varying model SYS:  XXX Not Implemented
%
%     The matrix N is set to zero when omitted. Also returned are (P,Pdot)
%     the solution and its derivative of the associated continuous-time 
%     Riccati differential equation (CRDE). If Tspan is a 2-by-1 vector 
%     then outputs (K,P,Pdot) are TVMATs specified on the solution times 
%     returned by ODE45.  If Tspan is an Nt-by-1 vector (with Nt>2) then 
%     the output TVMATs are specified on Tspan.
%
%     [K,P,Pdot,sol] = lqr(SYS,Q,...,Tspan,Opt) allows options for the
%     ODE45 solver to be specified. See ODESET for more help. This syntax
%     also returns the ODE45 solutions structure sol. This can be used to 
%     evaluate the CRDE solution at any time t using DEVAL:
%        [P,Pdot] = deval(sol,t);
%
%     [K,P,Pdot,sol] = lqr(A,B,Q,R,N,F,Tspan,Opt) is an equivalent syntax
%     for time-varying models with dynamics dx/dt = Ax + Bu
